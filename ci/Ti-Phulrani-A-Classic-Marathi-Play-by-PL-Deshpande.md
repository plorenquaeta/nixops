The play revolves around Professor Higgins, a linguistic expert who bets with his friend Colonel Pickering that he can teach Manjula, a street vendor who sells flowers, to speak proper Marathi and pass her off as a high-class lady. He takes her to his home and trains her for several months, correcting her pronunciation, grammar and manners. Along the way, he also develops feelings for her, but does not admit them. Manjula, on the other hand, grows fond of him and respects him as her teacher, but also feels hurt by his harsh criticism and indifference.
